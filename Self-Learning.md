# What I learnt During The Course Of This Project

1. Database Management Systems (DBMS): A database management system (DBMS) is a software system for creating and managing databases. A DBMS enables end users to create, protect, read, update and delete data in a database. It also manages security, data integrity and concurrency for databases.
Common functions in DBMS;
1. Administration tasks. A DBMS supports many typical database administration tasks, including change management, performance monitoring and tuning, security, and backup and recovery.
2. Storage. A DBMS provides efficient data storage and retrieval by ensuring that data is stored in tables, rows and columns.
3. Concurrency control. In environments where multiple users access and modify the database simultaneously, a DBMS guarantees controlled transaction execution to prevent data corruption or inconsistency.
4. Centralized view. A DBMS provides a centralized view of data that multiple users can access from multiple locations in a controlled manner. A DBMS can limit what data end users see and how they view the data, providing many views of a single database schema.
=> the difference between Relational DBMS and NoSQL;Relational databases require a predefined schema, enforcing a structured format for data storage. This ensures data consistency and integrity but can limit flexibility. NoSQL databases embrace a schema-less or flexible schema, allowing for the storage of unstructured or semi-structured data.
2.  I got to know Web Application Framework what server-side (backend) and client-side (forntend) frameworks exist and what they are used for.
3.  what RESTful API  and what it is used for in Web development: A RESTful API is an architectural style for an application programming interface that uses HTTP requests to access and use data. That data can be used to GET , PUT , POST and DELETE data types, which refers to reading, updating, creating and deleting operations related to resources.
4.  The I read about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) with its basic syntax and properties like color, font, text, background, margins, paddings, positions and many more 
   
   # Obstacle I came across
   Well to be honest this project was really hard. I came across some challenges like creating APIs and conncting them, installing react, then creating the react components but I got some help at the end from my Tuitor, Colleague and Stack overflow. They were really helpful for the completion of this project all thanks to them.

   # What I learnt
   I learnt how to deploy a To-Do Application that creates To-Do list with:
   1. MongoDB
   2. ExpressJS
   3. ReactJS
   4. Node.js
=> I also learnt how to use Postman to create APIs
=> I also learnt how to use MongoDm database mLab to be precise to store data.
